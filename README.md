What I found interesting what not the fact that using github copilot was beneficial to a coder;s productivity, but by how much more it was helpful. An experiment conducted found that completing tasks using github copilot was more than twice as fast as completing tasks without using copilot. A vast majority of coders using copilot also felt more fulfilled with their job and less frustrated when coding.



## Comment from Manny Soto Ruiz
What I found interesting was that copilot has the ability to adapt to the programmerâ€™s style of coding to offer solutions and suggest lines of code through its machine learning software. This bridges the gap between computers and humans.
